# Work Log - July 4, 2025: VAPI Conference Hold/Unhold Implementation

## Date: July 4, 2025
## Objective: Implement automatic VAPI unhold when human is detected
## Status: In Progress

## Overview
Building on the successful conference bridge implementation, today's focus was on implementing automatic hold/unhold functionality for VAPI participants in conference calls. The goal is to keep VAPI on hold until a human is detected, then automatically unhold them for seamless conversation handoff.

## Current System State (Start of Day)

### âœ… Already Working:
1. **Conference Creation**: Successfully creates Telnyx conferences
2. **VAPI Addition**: Adds VAPI assistant to conferences
3. **Clinic Dialing**: Dials target number (clinic) into conference
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Sends audio to WS server for DTMF and IVR classification
5. **IVR Classification**: Correctly classifies calls as `ivr_only`, `human`, or `ivr_then_human`
6. **Manual Unhold**: Created endpoint for manual curl requests to unhold participants

### ðŸ”§ Components Involved:
- `conference-webhook-bridge.js`: Handles conference events
- `voice-api-handler-vapi-bridge.js`: Main voice API webhook handler
- WebSocket server: Performs IVR classification and stores in database
- Database: `call_sessions` table with real-time enabled

## Implementation Approach

### Requirements Identified:
1. Place VAPI on hold when joining conference
2. Monitor for human detection in the clinic leg
3. Automatically unhold VAPI when human is detected
4. Keep solution simple and reliable

### Options Evaluated:

#### Option 1: Simple Database Polling
- Poll database every second for classification changes
- Self-contained within conference bridge
- Pros: Simple, reliable, no cross-system dependencies
- Cons: 1-second polling delay, resource usage

#### Option 2: Real-time Database Subscription âœ… SELECTED
- Use Supabase real-time to listen for classification updates
- Instant response when human detected
- Pros: Fastest response, efficient, leverages existing infrastructure
- Cons: Need to manage subscription lifecycle

#### Option 3: Direct WebSocket Notification
- WebSocket server calls webhook when human detected
- Pros: Direct notification path
- Cons: Cross-system dependency, network reliability concerns, complex error handling

## Implementation Details (Option 2)

### Key Components Added:

1. **Real-time Subscription Setup**:
   - Subscribe to `call_sessions` table UPDATE events
   - Filter for classification state changes
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

2. **VAPI Participant Tracking**:
   - `vapiParticipantsWaiting` Map to track held VAPI participants
   - Stores conference ID, participant ID, and metadata

3. **Automatic Unhold Logic**:
   - Triggers when `ivr_detection_state` changes to 'human'
   - Uses conference participant unhold endpoint
   - Updates database to reflect unhold status

4. **Safety Net Mechanism**:
   - Periodic check every 30 seconds
   - Catches any missed real-time events
   - Cleans up stale entries

### Database Fields Utilized:
- `conference_session_id`: Links conference to session
- `ivr_detection_state`: Classification result from WS server
- `vapi_on_hold`: Current hold status
- `vapi_participant_id`: Telnyx participant ID for unhold
- `conference_id`: Telnyx conference ID

## Technical Flow

```
1. VAPI joins conference â†’ Placed on hold
2. Clinic leg dialed â†’ Audio sent to WS server
3. WS server classifies call â†’ Updates database
4. Real-time subscription detects 'human' classification
5. Conference bridge unholds VAPI automatically
6. VAPI engages with human seamlessly
```

## Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `conference-webhook-bridge.js`:
   - Added real-time classification listener
   - Added VAPI participant tracking Map
   - Implemented automatic unhold on human detection
   - Added safety net periodic check
   - Enhanced logging throughout

### Key Functions Added:
- `initializeClassificationListener()`: Sets up real-time subscription
- `handleSubscriptionError()`: Manages reconnection with backoff
- Safety net interval check for reliability

## Testing Considerations

1. **Happy Path**: Human answers immediately
2. **IVR Navigation**: System navigates IVR, then human answers
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Real-time subscription disconnection
   - Network failures during unhold
   - Race conditions between setup and classification

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy updated conference bridge
2. **Monitor Logs**: Verify real-time events are received
3. **Test Scenarios**: Run through various call scenarios
4. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust timing if needed
5. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error recovery if issues found

## Potential Enhancements (Future)

1. Add metrics tracking for unhold latency
2. Implement unhold on `ivr_then_human` with delay
3. Add webhook notifications for unhold events
4. Create dashboard for monitoring hold/unhold status

## Notes

- Chose real-time approach for fastest response time
- Safety net ensures reliability even if real-time fails
- All logic contained within conference bridge (no WS server changes needed)
- Leverages existing database real-time infrastructure
