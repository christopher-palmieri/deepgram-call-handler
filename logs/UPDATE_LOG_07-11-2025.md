## Pre-Classification System Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a pre-classification system to identify clinic phone systems (human vs IVR) and cache results for 30 days, reducing call connection time and costs.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Updates
- **Added column to `call_sessions` table**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE call_sessions 
  ADD COLUMN clinic_phone TEXT;
  ```
  - Stores the phone number being called for classification tracking

#### 2. Edge Functions (Supabase)
- **Created `pre-classify-call` function**:
  - Initiates outbound calls to clinics for classification
  - Uses hardcoded `TO_NUMBER` env var for testing
  - Triggers TwiML webhook for call handling
  - Simple implementation without request body requirements

#### 3. Vercel Webhooks
- **Created `preclassify-twiml.js`**:
  - Handles incoming classification calls
  - Streams audio to Railway WebSocket server for classification
  - Simultaneously dials VAPI via SIP
  - Passes phone number as WebSocket parameter
  - Creates/updates `call_sessions` record

#### 4. Railway Server Updates
- **Updated `server_deepgram.js`**:
  - Fixed duplicate key error by checking for existing sessions before creating
  - Extracts phone number from WebSocket stream parameters
  - Stores phone number in `clinic_phone` field
  
- **Updated `supabase-logger-twilio.js`**:
  - Added automatic storage of classifications to `call_classifications` table
  - Collects IVR navigation actions from `ivr_events`
  - Uses phone number from session for classification storage
  - Handles both insert (new) and update (existing) classifications

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Dual streaming**: Calls stream to both Railway (for classification) and VAPI (for handling)
2. **Automatic classification storage**: Results automatically saved to `call_classifications` table
3. **IVR action collection**: Navigation steps (DTMF tones) captured for IVR systems
4. **30-day expiration**: Classifications expire after 30 days
5. **Verification counting**: Tracks how many times a classification has been verified

### Testing Flow
1. Call edge function: `POST /functions/v1/pre-classify-call`
2. Railway classifies the call as human/IVR
3. If IVR, collects navigation actions
4. Stores classification in `call_classifications` table
5. Future calls can use cached classification

### Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed duplicate key constraint errors in `call_sessions`
- ✅ Fixed phone number not being available for classification storage
- ✅ Removed dependency on `TO_NUMBER` env var in Railway (now passed via WebSocket)

### Next Steps
- Implement lookup of existing classifications before making pre-classification calls
- Add support for dynamic phone numbers (not hardcoded)
- Create automated cron job for periodic re-classification
- Implement the main call flow that uses cached classifications
