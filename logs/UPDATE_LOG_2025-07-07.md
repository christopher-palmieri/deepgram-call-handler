# Work Log - July 7, 2025: Single Row Architecture Implementation

## Date: July 7, 2025
## Objective: Refactor to single row per conference call architecture
## Status: In Progress - Schema mismatch issues identified

## Overview
Today we identified and began implementing a major architectural improvement to resolve the persistent VAPI hold/unhold issues. The core problem was that IVR classification was happening on one database row while conference monitoring was watching a different row, causing the real-time subscription to miss updates.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause Identified:
1. **Multiple rows per call**: System was creating separate rows for conference session and clinic leg
2. **Disconnected monitoring**: Classification happened on clinic leg row, but conference webhook monitored conference session row
3. **Edge function redundancy**: Voice-api-handler was calling edge function after human detection, but conference already existed
4. **Conflicting approaches**: Two scripts trying to manage the same flow independently

### Previous Architecture:
```
Initial call → WebSocket monitors → Human detected → Edge function called
                                                           ↓
                                                    NEW conference created
                                                           ↓
                                                    Multiple DB rows created
```

## Solution Design: Single Row Architecture

### New Architecture:
```
Edge function → Creates conference & single DB row
      ↓
VAPI joins → Updates same row
      ↓  
Clinic joins → Updates same row with leg info
      ↓
Human detected → Updates same row with classification
      ↓
Real-time trigger → Unholds VAPI
```

### Key Benefits:
- Single source of truth per conference
- No coordination issues between rows
- Real-time subscription can catch all updates
- Simpler, cleaner data model

## Implementation Changes

### voice-api-handler-vapi-bridge.js:
- ✅ Removed edge function calls
- ✅ Removed conference creation logic
- ✅ Added in-memory session mapping
- ✅ Simplified to only monitor and classify
- ✅ Updates single conference row

### conference-webhook-bridge.js:
- ✅ Fixed hold/unhold endpoints (using `/conferences/{id}/actions/hold|unhold`)
- ✅ Removed timer-based monitoring
- ✅ Kept real-time subscription
- ✅ Creates single row per conference
- ❌ Schema mismatch issues discovered

## Issues Discovered During Testing

### Error 1: Missing `call_id` in insert
- Conference webhook creates row without `call_id`
- Database requires `call_id` (NOT NULL constraint)
- Need to add `call_id` to insert statement

### Error 2: Column name mismatch
- Code references `clinic_leg_id` column
- Database only has `telnyx_leg_id` column
- Need to update code to match schema

## Technical Details

### In-Memory Session Tracking:
```javascript
const activeConferenceSessions = new Map();
// Stores conference_session_id for fast lookup during classification
```

### Hybrid Lookup Pattern:
1. Check memory first (fastest)
2. Fall back to database if needed
3. Self-cleaning after use

### Real-time Subscription:
- Watches for `ivr_detection_state` changes
- Triggers on UPDATE events
- Automatically unholds VAPI when human detected

## Next Steps

1. **Fix schema mismatches**:
   - Add `call_id` to conference session insert
   - Change `clinic_leg_id` references to `telnyx_leg_id`
   - Verify all column names match database

2. **Test complete flow**:
   - Edge function creates conference
   - VAPI joins and gets held
   - Clinic joins and updates row
   - Human classification triggers unhold

3. **Consider schema updates**:
   - Determine if we need additional columns
   - Ensure all required fields are present

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database schema must match code**: Column mismatches cause immediate failures
2. **Single row pattern is cleaner**: Eliminates coordination complexity
3. **In-memory caching helps**: Reduces race conditions for fast operations
4. **Real-time works when properly configured**: Table must be in publication and rows must match

## Questions for Next Session

1. What columns should be used for the single row?
2. Should `call_id` be the conference ID or session ID?
3. Are there other schema mismatches to address?

## Code Status

- voice-api-handler-vapi-bridge.js: ✅ Refactored (pending schema fixes)
- conference-webhook-bridge.js: ✅ Refactored (pending schema fixes)
- Database schema: ❌ Needs column verification
- Real-time subscription: ✅ Working when rows exist
