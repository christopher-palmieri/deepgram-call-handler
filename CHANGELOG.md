# Changelog - IVR Classification Systems

## [Current Work] - 2025-06-11

### Telnyx Implementation - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#### Added
- âœ… Audio buffering in `server_telnyx.js` to fix incomplete transcriptions
  - 160-byte buffer (20ms of audio at 8kHz)
  - Automatic flush after 20ms timeout
  - Ensures Deepgram receives complete audio chunks

#### Fixed
- âœ… Incomplete transcription issue resolved through audio buffering
- âœ… Maintained compatibility with shared `ivr-listener.js`

#### Known Issues
- ðŸ”§ DTMF tones not being delivered to calls
  - Polling mechanism finds actions
  - API calls appear to succeed
  - Tones not heard on call
  - Under active investigation

#### Architecture Decisions
- Kept `ivr-listener.js` shared between both implementations
- Audio buffering implemented only in Telnyx server
- Maintained identical classification pipeline

## [Previous] - 2025-06-10

### Telnyx Implementation - Initial Setup

#### Added
- Complete Telnyx Programmable Voice API integration
- WebSocket server (`server_telnyx.js`) on port 3002
- Webhook handler (`voice-api-handler.js`) for Telnyx events
- Polling mechanism for IVR action execution (2-second intervals)
- Query parameter support for call metadata in WebSocket URL

#### Changed
- Migrated from TwiML to Telnyx REST API calls
- Adapted call flow for Telnyx's event-driven architecture
- Modified WebSocket message handling for Telnyx format

#### Technical Details
- Stream configuration: `both_tracks` for full audio
- DTMF payload includes `duration_millis`, `client_state`, and `command_id`
- Polling continues until human detected or 2 minutes elapsed

## [Stable] - 2024-12-15

### Twilio Implementation - Production Ready

#### Core Features
- Real-time IVR classification (human/IVR/hybrid)
- Smart IVR navigation with selective action taking
- Fragment handling for split IVR messages
- WebSocket-based audio streaming with Deepgram
- Fast pattern-based classification with OpenAI fallback

#### Optimizations
- Connection reuse across TwiML redirects
- 30-second cleanup timers for idle connections
- Pre-warmed connection support (disabled by default)
- Efficient state management with in-memory cache

#### Database Schema
- `call_sessions` table for classification state
- `ivr_events` table for navigation actions
- Comprehensive logging with timestamps and confidence scores

---

## Migration Path

### From Twilio to Telnyx
1. **Shared Components** (No Changes Needed)
   - `ivr-listener.js`
   - All modules in `/modules/` directory
   - Database schema and Supabase integration
   - OpenAI and Deepgram configurations

2. **Platform-Specific Components**
   - Replace TwiML endpoints with Telnyx webhook handler
   - Deploy separate WebSocket server for Telnyx
   - Update environment variables for Telnyx API

3. **Key Differences**
   - Telnyx uses REST API instead of TwiML
   - Audio arrives in smaller chunks (requires buffering)
   - Actions executed via API calls, not redirects
   - Polling mechanism instead of webhook-driven flow
