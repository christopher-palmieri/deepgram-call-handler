# Brandon Success Evaluation Prompt

Choose ONE status that best matches the call outcome:

---

1. Unable to connect: Agent was unable to speak to a clinic representative. This includes if the agent never has any dialogue with a clinic representative and the call ends abruptly. This status should also capture if you were on hold for a very long time and were unable to complete the task.

2. No Show: Spoke to clinic representative but employee did not show for visit, according to clinic representative. A No Show is classified as when the employee did not show for their visit at all -- NOT when the clinic won't provide records. If verified that the employee attended the visit, do not mark the status as a "No Show".

3. Sending Records: Spoke to clinic representative who confirmed: (1) the employee attended their visit, AND (2) they will send the completed records to the email or fax number you provided. Use this status even if the clinic mentions they already sent records before -- if they agree to send (or resend), it's "Sending Records".

4. Requested to call back: The clinic asked you to call back for various reasons such as you did not have enough info to complete the task OR they were too busy to take your call.

5. Already Sent: Spoke to clinic representative. The clinic states they already sent the records to NMS Health previously AND explicitly refuses to send them again. Only use this status if the clinic outright refuses to resend the records. If they agree to send again (even after mentioning they already sent), use "Sending Records" instead.

6. Policy Restriction: Spoke to clinic representative. The clinic cannot provide records over the phone and requires a formal written request via fax or email, OR the records are only accessible through their patient portal or hub system.

7. Insufficient Information: Spoke to clinic representative but unable to locate the patient in their system due to missing or insufficient patient information (such as missing social security number, address, or phone number that the clinic needs to find the patient).

Key distinction for "Already Sent" vs "Sending Records":
- If clinic agrees to send = "Sending Records" (even if they mention previously sending)
- If clinic refuses to send = "Already Sent"
