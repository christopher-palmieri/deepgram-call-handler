# Development Log - Deepgram Call Handler

## September 5, 2025 - Real-time Dashboard Updates Issue

### Problem
Dashboard real-time updates for `pending_calls` table are not working. When a record is updated in Supabase, the dashboard doesn't automatically refresh to show the changes.

### Investigation Progress

#### ✅ What We've Confirmed Works
1. **Database Access**: Dashboard can read from `pending_calls` table successfully
2. **Authentication**: User is properly authenticated with MFA (aal2)
3. **Real-time Infrastructure**: Test page (`/test-realtime.html`) shows real-time updates work perfectly
4. **Test Channel**: Dashboard's "Test Realtime" button creates working subscription that receives updates

#### ❌ What's Not Working
- Main dashboard subscription doesn't receive `postgres_changes` events
- Updates to `pending_calls` records don't trigger dashboard refresh
- Manual refresh button works, but automatic updates fail

#### 🔧 Attempted Solutions
1. **Added Next Action column** to dashboard (✅ working)
2. **Fixed RLS policies** from `TO public` to `TO authenticated`
3. **Enabled realtime** for tables via multiple migrations:
   - `20250905-enable-realtime.sql`
   - `20250905-fix-rls-authenticated-policy.sql` 
   - `20250905-safe-enable-realtime.sql`
   - `20250905-force-enable-realtime.sql`
4. **Set REPLICA IDENTITY FULL** on all tables
5. **Added realtime config** to Supabase client initialization
6. **Split subscriptions** into separate channels
7. **Matched exact pattern** from working test-realtime.html
8. **Added fallback polling** mechanism (10-second intervals)

#### 🧪 Test Results
- **test-realtime.html**: ✅ Receives updates immediately
- **Dashboard Test Realtime button**: ✅ Creates working subscription
- **Main dashboard subscription**: ❌ Never receives events

#### 🔍 Current Status
The subscription shows as `SUBSCRIBED` but events never trigger the callback. This suggests:
- Real-time is properly configured at database level
- Authentication and permissions work
- Issue is specific to the main dashboard subscription timing or setup

#### 📊 Database Configuration Verified
- Publication `supabase_realtime` exists with all tables
- Tables have `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`
- RLS policies allow `SELECT` for `authenticated` role
- All necessary migrations applied

#### 🚨 Key Breakthrough - September 5, 2025 Evening
After extensive debugging, discovered the exact issue:

**What Works:**
- Test Realtime button: ✅ Receives updates immediately
- Dashboard subscription status: ✅ Shows `SUBSCRIBED` 
- System event received: ✅ `"Subscribed to PostgreSQL"`
- WebSocket connection: ✅ Active and healthy

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Main dashboard `postgres_changes` callback never fires
- No `🎯 MAIN SUBSCRIPTION UPDATE!` events despite updates to `pending_calls`
- Raw WebSocket messages show no postgres_changes events reaching the main subscription

**Current Status:**
The main subscription connects successfully (`SUBSCRIBED` status) and receives system confirmation (`"Subscribed to PostgreSQL"`), but postgres_changes events are not being delivered to the callback function. This suggests either:
1. Events are being filtered out at the Supabase level
2. There's a postgres_changes filter mismatch
3. Multiple subscriptions are causing conflicts
4. Row-level security is blocking events for this specific channel

**Debug Evidence:**
```
🔧 Main subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
✅ MAIN SUBSCRIPTION IS ACTIVE!
🔧 SYSTEM EVENT: {message: 'Subscribed to PostgreSQL', status: 'ok'}
```

But no postgres_changes events despite database updates.

### Next Critical Steps
1. Check if RLS policies block real-time events differently than direct queries
2. Test with a completely different table to isolate pending_calls-specific issues  
3. Compare exact WebSocket traffic between working test button and failing main subscription
4. Investigate if Supabase real-time has table-specific or user-specific filtering

### Files Modified
- `public/dashboard.html` - Added Next Action column
- `public/scripts/dashboard.js` - Multiple subscription improvements
- `public/scripts/config.js` - Added realtime configuration
- `public/test-realtime.html` - Created diagnostic tool
- `migrations/20250905-*` - Database realtime configuration

### Console Logs to Monitor

🚀 Setting up realtime subscription...
Creating channel exactly like working test...
Dashboard subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
✅ Dashboard realtime ACTIVE - updates should work now!
🎯 DASHBOARD UPDATE RECEIVED! <- This never appears
